# The Study
A learning resource that I am building to share with my team members who would like to collaborate.
FILE NAME GUIDE
pb = playbook
example pb_host_info.yaml is a ansible playbook that returns information about your inventory devices in a file called host.ini

INVENTORY
you will need to create a host.ini file 
It should look something like this:
[raspberry_pis]
	raspberry_pi_1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
	raspberry_pi_2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
	raspberry_pi_3 ansible_host=192.168.1.12

Replace 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11, and 192.168.1.12 with the actual IP addresses of your Raspberry Pis.

# Welcome to The Study! üìö‚ú®

Hey there, curious minds! üåü Welcome to *The Study* - your unconventional sanctuary of knowledge, where the fusion of Mark Twain's wit meets the undeniable charm of "Sex and the City". Yes, you read it right. We're all about learning, but who says we can't do it with a flair of sass and sophistication?

## What's This Hub About? ü§î

Imagine a place where git flows as gracefully as Carrie Bradshaw's prose, where Kubernetes clusters are as interconnected as Samantha's social life, where Docker containers are as compact and efficient as Miranda's legal arguments, and where Python slithers smoothly through our projects, injecting elegance and simplicity. Welcome to our little corner of the GitHub universe, where we demystify tech while having a blast.

### Our Arsenal of Knowledge üõ†Ô∏è

- **Git & GitHub**: Unravel the mysteries of version control, branch out (pun intended) your skills, and collaborate like the close-knit, albeit dysfunctional family we are.
- **Kubernetes**: Or as we like to call it, the orchestrator of our digital cosmos. Let's navigate the high seas of container management together, shall we?
- **Docker**: Packaging applications with all their quirks, much like packing for a fabulous vacation. It's compact, consistent, and surprisingly less chaotic than you'd think.
- **Python**: The language that's as versatile as it is powerful, much like a well-tailored suit or the perfect pair of heels. It's the backbone of our automations and the heart of our operations.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Because, darling, manual setups are so pass√©. We're all about that code-defined elegance.
- **DevOps**: Merging the worlds of development and operations with the grace of a well-mixed Cosmopolitan.
- **Ansible & Terraform**: Our tools of choice for whispering sweet nothings to our servers and infrastructure, ensuring they align perfectly with our wildest tech fantasies.

### Why You Should Hang Out Here üíñ

- **Share and Shine**: This is your runway to showcase what you know, learn from others, and elevate your tech persona.
- **Innovation Central**: Witness the fusion of creativity and technology, where ideas spark brighter than Sarah Jessica Parker's sequined dress.
- **The Home Lab Chronicles**: Dive into the tales of my home lab, powered by the humble yet mighty Raspberry Pi. It's where I tinker, experiment, and occasionally blow things up (figuratively... or not).

## Join the Journey üöÄ

Whether you're here to refine your skills, share your knowledge, or just for the sheer joy of learning something new, you've come to the right place. Let's embark on this enlightening journey together, sprinkling a little bit of humor, a dash of sass, and loads of invaluable insights along the way.

Remember, in *The Study*, we don't just learn; we thrive, we laugh, and we might even spill some tea. So, grab your favorite beverage, settle in, and let's make some magic happen!

*"Learning is what most adults will do for a living in the 21st century."* ‚Äì Perpetually attributed to Mark Twain, probably because it sounds cool.
